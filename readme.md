CTRL + X

🔁 Token Mapping Logic
Slot	Token Used
1	Token line 1
2	Token line 2
3	Token line 1
4	Token line 2

➡️ No need to paste the same token multiple times.

▶️ Run the Tool (IMPORTANT)

⚠️ Android shared storage is noexec, so do NOT use ./

✅ Correct command:
```bash
bash start_4.sh
```

Important timing note:

Run the tool before 00:00 Beijing time and keep Termux/tmux open.

The script waits for the next Beijing midnight quota window, then sends the timed request burst automatically. If you start it after 00:00 Beijing time, it will target the next day's midnight window.


or
```bash
ash start_4.sh
```

🖥️ What Happens Next

tmux opens automatically

Screen splits into 4 boxes

Each box runs the script

Each box asks:

[Slot number (1-4)]:

Enter:

Box 1 → 1

Box 2 → 2

Box 3 → 3

Box 4 → 4

📊 Live Logs

Each box shows:

Beijing time (NTP or system fallback)

Waiting status

Request send time

API response

🧠 Notes & Tips

Wi-Fi recommended (mobile data may block NTP)

If NTP fails, script automatically uses system time

Do NOT close Termux while running

Detach tmux safely:

CTRL + B → D


Re-attach:

tmux attach

❗ Common Errors & Fixes
❌ permission denied
